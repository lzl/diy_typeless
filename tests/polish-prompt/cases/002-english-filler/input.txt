so um basically what I wanted to talk about is like the new authentication system right so we need to like support both OAuth and like API keys and um the thing is that the current implementation you know it only handles like basic auth which is you know not really secure enough for production and uh I think we should also add like rate limiting to prevent like abuse and stuff like that oh and also we need to make sure the tokens expire after like 24 hours or something
